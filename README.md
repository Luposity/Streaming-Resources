# <b>Luposity's Streaming Resources</b>
You'll find all my Streaming resources here that I use for my own Streams.
Feel free to use them for yourself, credit does not need to be provided but it's appreciated.

In the Streamer.bot folder you'll find raw C# files and the Streamer.bot import strings.
>[!IMPORTANT]
>All the resources utilize Streamer.bot v1.0.1 at least.<br>
>I cannot guarantee any of the resources are backwards compatable with older versions of Streamer.bot.

You'll find my own Streamer.bot DLL Extension listed as Luponium, useful if your working with Streamer.bot's Execute C# Code Action.

## Personal Twitch Channel Commands & Triggers
I couldn't think anywhere else to put all my Twitch Commands, so you can find them all here, provided with all the triggers, role requirements etc.
>[!NOTE]
>Any chat messages starting with "!" will not be read out aloud during Beat Saber Streams. I utilize Speaker.Bot and reads out all chat messages during VR Streams
